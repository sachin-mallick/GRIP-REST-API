# GRIP-REST-API
I Have Built REST API using PHP and MySQL database<br>
I have performed following operations:-<br>
    1. Insert data<br>
    2. retrieve data<br>
    3. update data<br>
    4. delete data<br> 
I have built 3 API's:- <br>
    1.Student table<br>
    2.Teacher table<br>
    3.Subject table<br>
I have tested CRUD features for Student table, API can also be tested for Teacher and Subject tables.
