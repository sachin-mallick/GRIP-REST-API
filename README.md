# GRIP-REST-API
I Have Built REST API using PHP and MySQL database<br>
I have performed following operations:-<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  1. Insert data<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  2. retrieve data<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  3. update data<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  4. delete data<br> 
I have built 3 API's:- <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  1.Student table<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  2.Teacher table<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  3.Subject table<br>
I have tested CRUD features for Student table, API can also be tested for Teacher and Subject tables.
