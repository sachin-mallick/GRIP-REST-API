# GRIP-REST-API
I Have Built REST API using PHP and MySQL database
I have performed following operations:-
    1. Insert data
    2. retrieve data
    3. update data
    4. delete data 
I have built 3 API's 
    1.Student table
    2.Teacher table
    3.Subject table
I have tested CRUD features for Student table, API can also be tested for Teacher and Subject tables.
